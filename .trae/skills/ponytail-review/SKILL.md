  Code review focused exclusively on over-engineering. Finds what to delete:
  reinvented standard library, unneeded dependencies, speculative abstractions,
  dead flexibility. One line per finding: location, what to cut, what replaces
  it. Use when the user says "review for over-engineering", "what can we
  delete", "is this over-engineered", "simplify review", or requests a
  ponytail-style review.

# Ponytail Review

## Description

Review diffs for unnecessary complexity. One line per finding: location, what
to cut, what replaces it. The diff's best outcome is getting shorter.

Complements correctness-focused review — this one only hunts complexity.

## When to use

Use when the user:
- Says "review for over-engineering", "what can we delete"
- Says "is this over-engineered", "simplify review"
- Requests a ponytail-style review of a diff or code change
- Asks "is there anything here I don't need"

## Instructions

### Format:
`L<line>: <tag> <what>. <replacement>.` (or `<file>:L<line>: ...` for multi-file diffs)

### Tags:
- **`delete:`** — dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement: nothing.
- **`stdlib:`** — hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function.
- **`native:`** — dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name the feature.
- **`yagni:`** — abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer with one caller.
- **`shrink:`** — same logic, fewer lines. Show the shorter form.

### Review process:
1. Read the diff or code provided.
2. Scan for each of the five tag categories.
3. Produce one line per finding with the format above.
4. End with the only metric that matters: `net: -<N> lines possible.`
5. If there is nothing to cut, say `Lean already. Ship.` and stop.

### Boundaries:
- Complexity only. Correctness bugs, security holes, and performance go to a normal review pass, not this one.
- A single smoke test or `assert`-based self-check is the ponytail minimum, not bloat — never flag it for deletion.
- Does not apply the fixes, only lists them.

## Examples

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "This EmailValidator class might be more complex than necessary, have you considered whether all these validation rules are needed at this stage?" | `L12-38: stdlib: 27-line validator class. "@" in email, 1 line, real validation is the confirmation mail.` |
| N/A | `L4: native: moment.js imported for one format call. Intl.DateTimeFormat, 0 deps.` |
| N/A | `repo.py:L88: yagni: AbstractRepository with one implementation. Inline it until a second one exists.` |
| N/A | `L52-71: delete: retry wrapper around an idempotent local call. Nothing replaces it.` |
| N/A | `L30-44: shrink: manual loop builds dict. dict(zip(keys, values)), 1 line.` |
